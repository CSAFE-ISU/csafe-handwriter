Handwriter constructs writer profiles from handwriting samples.

## Handwriting Samples

Handwriter takes scanned handwriting samples saved as PNG images. For best results, scan your samples at 300 DPI.

## Handwriting as Shapes

Handwriter splits the scanned handwriting into component shapes called *graphs*. Graphs capture shapes, not necessarily individual letters. They might be a part of a letter or contain parts of multiple letters.

## Common Handwriting Shapes

Handwriter analyzed handwriting samples from 100 writers, grouping the tens of thousands of graphs into 40 forty clusters of similar shapes with a K-Means clustering algorithm. The result is a *cluster template* of 40 exemplar handwriting shapes. These shapes might be part of a letter or contain parts of multiple letters. The cluster template is used to estimate writer profiles.

## Writer Profiles

Each graph in a handwriting sample is matched to its most similar shape in the cluster template. By counting how often a writer uses graphs from each cluster, handwriter creates a profile of a writer's handwriting style. This profile shows the writer's tendency to form shapes in particular ways.
