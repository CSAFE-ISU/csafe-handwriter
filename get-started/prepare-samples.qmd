## Best Practices for Handwriter

When using Handwriter to analyze handwriting samples, follow these guidelines:

1. **Scan Resolution**: Always scan handwriting samples at 300 DPI resolution.

2. **File Format**: Save scans directly as PNG images.
   - If your scanner doesn't support PNG format, save as TIFF first, then convert to PNG using software like Adobe Photoshop.

3. **Lined Paper**: The current version of handwriter has only been tested on  white, unlined paper. If your handwriting samples are on lined paper, remove the lines using software like Adobe Photoshop.

## Known Limitations

1. **Document Length**: Tests of handwriter on benchmark datasets show that its accuracy decreases as the amount of the handwriting decreases. The best results occur when handwriting samples are at least a paragraph in length, and the accuracy decreases for shorter samples.

2. **Resolution Issues**:
   - Using scan resolution lower than 300 DPI significantly decreases comparison accuracy
   - Comparing samples scanned at different resolutions reduces reliability

3. **Format Conversion Problems**:
   - Scanning handwriting as PDF and then converting to PNG can degrade writing quality
   - This degradation directly impacts analysis accuracy
   
4. **Signatures**: Handwriter is not intended for use on signatures.
